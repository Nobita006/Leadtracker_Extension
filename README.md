# Leadtracker_Extension

This is a Chrome Extension I created while learning Javascript.
It can store current active tab and any other tab you input. Data is stored in local storage so that it is not deleted while refreshing.

You can access the extension on this website - https://nobita006.github.io/Leadtracker_Extension/
"SAVE TAB" funtion will only work after its installed as an extension
